Work Schedules
This should be composed of 2 ranges of 4 hours, separated by a 1 hour or 2 hours pause in between. If you want to start before 7am (UTC+8) or want to finish after 9pm (UTC+8), please let  know. Make also sure you have sufficient collision with the rest of all members of the team you are working with (5 hours per day).

WARNING: Please note that we are quite flexible about the schedule, but rigourous about working the minumum amount of hours. We understand that there is temptation to not work the expected amount of time, but if that is the case, we'd prefer you work in another company.

WARNING: During a workday at Mazecare, employees are not permitted to work on any tasks or projects that have not been discussed and approved by the company. This policy applies both before and after work hours, and extends to activities such as attending school, taking exams, or engaging in any external or third-party work. If you need time off for these purposes, please request a day off or discuss the possibility of taking non-paid leave with your . This policy is in place because we believe that focusing on multiple tasks in a single day can be detrimental to productivity. Therefore, we encourage employees to utilize weekends, public holidays, or their paid leave to address these external commitments.
Holidays (public or leaves)
Always ask  when requesting for holiday leave, preferably in advance. The goal is to make sure there is no interruption of service and that everybody knows that during these days, nobody should count on you.
Once holiday is confirmed, make sure to tell in the general channel
Once holiday is confirmed, make sure to put Out Of Office event on google calendar

Mazecare Culture
We tend to follow the Tesla and/or Netflix Culture:

https://jobs.netflix.com/culture
Make sure you read the whole document.

Some added important points we abide by:
We are all full-time and dedicated to the team
Anything we do outside of work should not affect the quality and value you bring to the team
We are all fully remote
We strive for perfect English communication, both orally and in written
We are pro-active and we help each other

“That’s not my job” - The more senior you become, the more your job will involve filling gaps and stepping up to handle situations that aren’t anyone’s job.  Your job is to make your organization successful (whatever that means).  There is no “that’s not my job” anymore.

Team Communications
Make sure to avoid private messages about anything that relates to the product/team you are working on if there is already a group chat about that. Except if it's actually something private. Keep the discussion inside the space of the team
If you have a change of availability, make sure to let your team know.
During availability hours, you need to be reactive on messages being sent with your name in it. Please setup your notifications accordingly.
In Mazecare, we think that real time conversations are better than chatty async communications. When something to communicate seems to have many branch of decisions, state the topic of a call and join that call.

Task Management best practices
We do not have an exact standard as we want to be as agile as possible.
But as a general rule of thumb, here are some first principles:

Tasks are supposed to be "User Stories". They should be self-contained, from research, to UX (Figma), to development, to connection with backend, to testing, to deployment
You should always have at least one task in IN PROGRESS and one task in TODO. If not, please make sure to ask your team to create/allocate more tasks to you
Try to have only one assignee per task. It is usually not recommended to depend on others to complete a full task.
Try to have the task as small as possible in terms of amount of work
Avoid subtasks / prefer checklists

Code, Branches & Pull Requests best practices
Making sure the code in all branches is never stale is very important. For this to happen, we cannot have branches that are more than 2 working days old
Make sure that all code pushed to remote is tested locally, is functional, and doesn't break anything else
Make sure to have a PR approved and commented on real-time. PRs need to be discussed in a call. No asynchronous work for PR.  
To make sure this is well respected, make sure that you are not a blocker for approving pull requests
Often, reviewing pull requests is more important than coding a new feature, so make sure all code that is reviewed passes a certain bar of quality
Always work on the oldest PR as a priority (unless explicitly said otherwise). If you are working on another branch and a previous PR has been reviewed and changes are requested, save your current work, and go back to that PR.
