    participant Your System
    participant Mazecare API
    participant Mazecare Database

    Your System->>Mazecare API: Request (e.g., Get Patient Data)
    Mazecare API->>Mazecare Database: Query Data
    Mazecare Database-->>Mazecare API: Response Data
    Mazecare API-->>Your System: Response (e.g., Patient Data)
